The core objective is to leverage historical financial and behavioral data to build predictive models and generate actionable insights.\n","The project addresses several key business challenges that financial institutions commonly face:\n"," * Credit Score Prediction: The project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting a customer's credit score. By analyzing historical data, the model will classify a customer's credit profile as \"Good,\" \"Standard,\" or \"Poor.\" This is particularly useful for evaluating new customers or those with limited financial history, enabling the bank to make more accurate lending decisions.\n"," * Loan Default Risk Reduction: A critical component of the project is to reduce the rate of loan defaults. We will build a risk classification model that identifies high-risk individuals early in the loan approval process. This model will use behavioral patterns such as late payments, multiple credit inquiries, and high outstanding debt. By flagging these applicants, the bank can take proactive measures to either deny the loan or offer it with more stringent terms, thereby protecting its financial assets.\n"," * Customer Segmentation: To enhance marketing and product offerings, the project will use clustering techniques (such as K-means) to segment customers into distinct groups. These segments will be based on income, spending habits, and other behavioral characteristics. This allows the bank to offer personalized products, like tailored credit card options or investment plans, that are better suited to each customer segment's needs and financial behavior.\n"," * Improving Financial Decision-Making: Ultimately, the project's goal is to empower the bank's decision-makers with data-driven insights. By providing predictive models and a deeper understanding of customer behavior, the project will improve the efficiency and accuracy of loan approvals, risk management, and marketing strategies.\n","The proposed solution involves a multi-pronged approach. We will start by cleaning and preparing the data, followed by building and training machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for prediction tasks. We will also perform exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns, such as the relationship between lower credit utilization and higher credit scores. Additionally, the project will incorporate anomaly detection techniques to identify sudden and unusual changes in a customer's credit behavior, which could be an early warning sign of distress or fraud. Finally, the insights and model predictions will be visualized through a dashboard, providing loan recovery and management teams with a clear overview of customer risk profiles and enabling them to prioritize their efforts effectively.\n","In summary, this project is a comprehensive solution that uses advanced analytics and machine learning to improve the bank’s operational efficiency, reduce financial risk, and ultimately enhance its profitability and customer relationships. The outcomes will not only help in making smarter lending decisions but also in fostering a more personalized and secure banking experience for customers."],"metadata":{"id":"7Oze_iis2KpR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_bfLyfU-QR1r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Write the summary here within 500-600 words."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Write Problem Statement Here.\n","\n","\n","Credit Score Prediction\n","Many financial institutions struggle with evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals, especially new customers with limited financial history.
